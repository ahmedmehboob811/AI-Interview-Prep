# Debugging Backend and Frontend Vite Project

## Backend Debugging
- [ ] Check for missing environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY, MONGODB_URI, PORT)
- [ ] Verify all routes and middleware are correctly set up
- [ ] Test backend endpoints for proper responses
- [ ] Check for any runtime errors in server.js and services

## Frontend Debugging
- [ ] Fix import errors in InterviewPrep.jsx (API_PATH to API_PATHS, correct component paths)
- [ ] Update apiPaths.js with missing API endpoints (AI_GENERATE_MORE_QUESTIONS, TOGGLE_PIN)
- [ ] Install moment library for date formatting
- [ ] Fix any corrupted files (InterviewPrep.jsx has "t-" prefix)
- [ ] Verify axiosInstance and API paths configuration
- [ ] Test API calls from frontend to backend
- [ ] Check image upload utility integration

## Testing
- [ ] Run backend server with nodemon to catch errors
- [ ] Run frontend vite dev server and check console for errors
- [ ] Test all API endpoints and frontend flows
